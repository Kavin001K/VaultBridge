# Terms of Engagement

**Version:** 3.0 (Quantum)

---

## 1. The Agreement
By initializing a secure channel on VaultBridge, you agree to these terms. If you intend to use this platform for malicious acts, leave now.

## 2. The Service
VaultBridge provides ephemeral, encrypted data transfer. 
* **Universal Clipboard**: A real-time synchronization tool.
* **Vaults**: Time-limited encrypted file storage.

## 3. Usage Rules (The "Don't Be Evil" Clause)
You agree NOT to use VaultBridge for:
* Hosting malware, ransomware, or C2 infrastructure.
* Distributing child exploitation material (CSAM).
* Phishing or social engineering.

**Abuse Policy:** While we cannot read your files, we monitor network traffic patterns. If your connection behaves like a botnet or abusive script, we will ban your IP range / subnet without warning.

## 4. No Warranties (The "Use At Your Own Risk" Clause)
This software is provided "as is." 
* We guarantee the **math** (AES-256 is solid).
* We do NOT guarantee **availability**. We are not a backup service. If your timer runs out, your data is incinerated. If our server catches fire, your data is gone. 
* **Do not use VaultBridge as long-term storage.**

## 5. Liability
You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the custody of your encryption keys (PINs/Links). If you lose them, we cannot help you. If you share them with the wrong person, we cannot stop them.

## 6. Termination
We reserve the right to terminate connections that destabilize our infrastructure.

## 7. Governing Law
Code is Law. But for the lawyers: These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

*Encrypt everything. Trust nothing.*

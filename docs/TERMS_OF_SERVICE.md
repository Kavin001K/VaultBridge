## 2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

### 2.1 Overview of VaultBridge

VaultBridge is a privacy-first, zero-knowledge encrypted file transfer platform designed to facilitate secure sharing of digital content. The Service enables Users to:

(a) **Upload and Encrypt Files**: Users can upload files of various types and sizes, which are automatically encrypted in the browser using AES-256-GCM encryption before transmission to VaultBridge servers.

(b) **Generate Secure Access Mechanisms**: The Service creates unique Access Codes and Direct Links for sharing encrypted content with Authorized Users.

(c) **Control Access Parameters**: Senders can configure expiration times (ranging from one hour to seven days) and download limits (ranging from one to one hundred downloads) for each Vault.

(d) **Download and Decrypt Files**: Receivers can access Vaults using provided credentials, with decryption occurring entirely within their browser.

(e) **Automatic Content Deletion**: Vaults are automatically and permanently deleted upon expiration or when download limits are reached, implementing "burn-on-read" functionality.

### 2.2 Service Features

The VaultBridge Service includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

**2.2.1 Client-Side Encryption**
All encryption and decryption operations occur within the User's web browser using the Web Crypto API. VaultBridge servers never receive, process, or store unencrypted Content or Encryption Keys.

**2.2.2 Adaptive Chunking**
Large files are intelligently divided into chunks based on file size and network conditions, optimizing upload performance while maintaining security.

**2.2.3 Resumable Uploads**
The Service utilizes IndexedDB to persist upload state, enabling Users to resume interrupted uploads from the last successful chunk.

**2.2.4 Streamed Decryption**
Service Workers enable memory-efficient download of large files by streaming decryption, preventing browser memory exhaustion for files exceeding available RAM.

**2.2.5 Directory Upload Support**
Users may upload entire folder structures, which are automatically compressed into a single encrypted archive while preserving the directory hierarchy.

**2.2.6 WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Transfer**
Optional "Live Link" mode enables direct peer-to-peer file transfer between Users without server-side storage, providing maximum privacy for real-time transfers.

**2.2.7 Password Protection (Two-Factor)**
Optional password-based protection adds a second layer of security, requiring both the Access Code/Link and a user-defined password to access Content.

**2.2.8 Multi-File Download**
Vaults containing multiple files support bulk download as a client-side generated ZIP archive.

### 2.3 Service Availability

---

## 7. ZERO-KNOWLEDGE ARCHITECTURE

### 7.1 Technical Implementation

VaultBridge employs a zero-knowledge architecture, meaning:

(a) **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption operations occur entirely within your web browser using the Web Crypto API. Encryption keys are generated locally and never transmitted to VaultBridge servers.

(b) **Split-Code Access**: When using Access Codes, the Lookup ID (first three digits) is transmitted to our servers to identify the Vault, but the PIN (last three digits) is never transmitted. The PIN is used locally to derive the decryption key.

(c) **URL Fragment Keys**: For Direct Links, the encryption key is stored in the URL fragment (after the # symbol), which browsers do not transmit in HTTP requests.

(d) **Encrypted Metadata**: File names, types, and other metadata are encrypted before upload, making them inaccessible to VaultBridge.

### 7.2 Implications for Users

The zero-knowledge architecture has important implications:

(a) **Enhanced Privacy**: VaultBridge cannot access, view, or analyze your Content, providing strong privacy protection.

(b) **No Key Recovery**: VaultBridge cannot recover lost Access Codes, PINs, passwords, or encryption keys. If you lose access credentials, the Content is permanently inaccessible.

(c) **Limited Abuse Prevention**: We cannot proactively scan Content for prohibited materials. Enforcement relies on external reports and indicators.

(d) **User Responsibility**: You bear sole responsibility for maintaining security of access credentials and determining the appropriateness of Content.

### 7.3 Security Guarantees

The zero-knowledge architecture provides the following security guarantees:

(a) VaultBridge employees cannot view your file contents;

(b) A database breach would not expose unencrypted Content;

(c) Legal requests for Content cannot be fulfilled because we cannot decrypt it;

(d) Your files remain private even from VaultBridge itself.

### 7.4 Technical Limitations

Users should understand these technical limitations:

(a) **Network Metadata**: While Content is encrypted, network-level metadata (IP addresses, timestamps, file sizes) may be observable by VaultBridge and network intermediaries.

(b) **Browser Security**: The security of client-side encryption depends on the integrity of your browser and device. Compromised browsers or devices may expose Content.

(c) **Access Credential Security**: The security of your Content depends on keeping Access Codes, Direct Links, and passwords confidential.

(d) **Implementation Trust**: Users must trust that VaultBridge's open-source implementation correctly implements zero-knowledge principles.

---

## 8. ENCRYPTION AND SECURITY

### 8.1 Encryption Standards

VaultBridge employs the following cryptographic standards:

(a) **File Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode), providing both confidentiality and integrity.

(b) **Key Derivation for PINs**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations, converting 3-digit PINs into secure key material.

(c) **Key Derivation for Passwords**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations, providing enhanced protection for optional password-based encryption.

(d) **Initialization Vectors**: 96-bit random IVs generated using cryptographically secure random number generators for each chunk.

(e) **Random Code Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation for Access Codes.

### 8.2 Security Architecture

The VaultBridge security architecture includes:

(a) **Transport Layer Security**: All communications between clients and servers use TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2 with strong cipher suites.

(b) **Security Headers**: Implementation of Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and other security headers.

(c) **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute-force attacks through IP-based rate limiting on authentication endpoints.

(d) **No Persistent Storage**: No use of localStorage, cookies, or persistent client-side storage (except IndexedDB for resumable uploads, which is cleared after use).

(e) **Automatic Deletion**: Guaranteed deletion of Content upon expiration or download limit exhaustion.

### 8.3 Security Limitations

While we implement robust security measures, Users should be aware:

(a) **No Perfect Security**: No system can guarantee perfect security. We continually work to identify and address vulnerabilities.

(b) **User Device Security**: The security of your Content depends on the security of your devices and browsers.

(c) **Credential Compromise**: If Access Codes, Direct Links, or passwords are compromised, the Content they protect may be accessed by unauthorized parties.

(d) **Future Threats**: Advances in cryptanalysis or quantum computing may eventually threaten current encryption standards. We commit to updating our cryptographic implementations as needed.

### 8.4 Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in VaultBridge, please report it responsibly to security@vaultbridge.app. We operate a responsible disclosure program and appreciate the security community's assistance in keeping our users safe.

## 9. FILE STORAGE AND RETENTION

### 9.1 Storage Infrastructure

VaultBridge utilizes secure cloud infrastructure for storing encrypted Content:

(a) Files are stored in encrypted form on cloud storage services with industry-standard security certifications.

(b) Geographic redundancy may be employed, meaning encrypted Content may be replicated across multiple data centers.

(c) All stored data is encrypted at rest using platform encryption in addition to VaultBridge's client-side encryption.

### 9.2 Retention Periods

Content is retained only until one of the following occurs:

(a) **User-Defined Expiration**: The expiration time set by the Sender (1 hour to 7 days).

(b) **Download Limit**: The download limit set by the Sender (1 to 100 downloads).

(c) **Manual Deletion**: If future features enable manual deletion by the Sender.

### 9.3 Deletion Process

When Content is deleted:

(a) All encrypted file chunks are permanently removed from storage.

(b) Vault metadata records are deleted from the database.

(c) No backups or copies are retained.

(d) Deletion is immediate and synchronous for download-limit triggers; for expiration-based deletion, a cleanup process runs regularly.

### 9.4 Size Limits

VaultBridge may impose file and Vault size limits:

(a) Maximum individual file size: Subject to network and browser constraints.

(b) Maximum total Vault size: Subject to change based on infrastructure capacity.

(c) Maximum files per Vault: Subject to practical limits.

We reserve the right to adjust these limits at any time.

### 9.5 No Backup or Recovery

VaultBridge does not maintain backups of encrypted Content. This design choice:

(a) Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to historical data.

(b) Ensures that deletion is truly permanent.

(c) Means we cannot recover Content that has been deleted or encrypted with lost keys.

Users requiring backup capabilities should maintain their own copies of files before encryption and upload.

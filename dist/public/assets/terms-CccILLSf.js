            ` }, { id: "privacy", title: "6. Privacy and Data Protection", content: `
### Privacy Policy

Our collection, use, and protection of your information is governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in the Privacy Policy.

### Data We Do Not Collect

Due to our zero-knowledge architecture, VaultBridge does not collect, store, or have access to:
- Unencrypted file contents;
- File names, types, or metadata (these are encrypted before upload);
- Encryption keys used to protect your Content;
- The complete Access Codes (we only store the Lookup ID portion);
- Passwords used for optional password protection.

### Data We May Collect

To operate the Service, we may collect and process:
- **IP Addresses**: For security, rate limiting, and abuse prevention;
- **Usage Data**: Aggregate, anonymized statistics about Service usage;
- **Technical Data**: Browser type, device information, and other technical details;
- **Vault Metadata**: Non-content information about Vaults, including encrypted metadata blobs;
- **Email Addresses**: Only when you optionally use the "Email Link" feature.

### Data Retention

Vault data (encrypted files and metadata) is automatically and permanently deleted:
- When the user-defined expiration time is reached;
- When the download limit is reached (burn-on-read);
- Upon completion of any data deletion request.

We do not maintain backups of deleted Vault data.
            ` }, { id: "zero-knowledge", title: "7. Zero-Knowledge Architecture", content: `
### Technical Implementation

VaultBridge employs a zero-knowledge architecture, meaning:

**Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption operations occur entirely within your web browser using the Web Crypto API. Encryption keys are generated locally and never transmitted to VaultBridge servers.

**Split-Code Access**: When using Access Codes, the Lookup ID (first three digits) is transmitted to our servers to identify the Vault, but the PIN (last three digits) is never transmitted. The PIN is used locally to derive the decryption key.

**URL Fragment Keys**: For Direct Links, the encryption key is stored in the URL fragment (after the # symbol), which browsers do not transmit in HTTP requests.

**Encrypted Metadata**: File names, types, and other metadata are encrypted before upload, making them inaccessible to VaultBridge.

### Implications for Users

The zero-knowledge architecture has important implications:

- **Enhanced Privacy**: VaultBridge cannot access, view, or analyze your Content, providing strong privacy protection.
- **No Key Recovery**: VaultBridge cannot recover lost Access Codes, PINs, passwords, or encryption keys. If you lose access credentials, the Content is permanently inaccessible.
- **Limited Abuse Prevention**: We cannot proactively scan Content for prohibited materials. Enforcement relies on external reports and indicators.
- **User Responsibility**: You bear sole responsibility for maintaining security of access credentials and determining the appropriateness of Content.

### Security Guarantees

The zero-knowledge architecture provides the following security guarantees:
- VaultBridge employees cannot view your file contents;
- A database breach would not expose unencrypted Content;
- Legal requests for Content cannot be fulfilled because we cannot decrypt it;
- Your files remain private even from VaultBridge itself.
            ` }, { id: "encryption", title: "8. Encryption and Security", content: `
### Encryption Standards

VaultBridge employs the following cryptographic standards:

**File Encryption: AES-256-GCM**
- Algorithm: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Key Size: 256 bits
- Mode: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
- Properties: Provides both confidentiality and integrity

**Key Derivation for PINs: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256**
- 100,000 iterations
- Converting 3-digit PINs into secure key material

**Key Derivation for Passwords: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256**
- 600,000 iterations
- Enhanced protection for optional password-based encryption

**Initialization Vectors**
- 96-bit random IVs generated using cryptographically secure random number generators for each chunk

### Security Architecture

The VaultBridge security architecture includes:
- **Transport Layer Security**: All communications use TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2 with strong cipher suites
- **Security Headers**: Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and other security headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute-force attacks through IP-based rate limiting
- **No Persistent Storage**: No use of localStorage, cookies, or persistent client-side storage
- **Automatic Deletion**: Guaranteed deletion of Content upon expiration or download limit exhaustion

### Security Limitations

While we implement robust security measures, Users should be aware:
- No system can guarantee perfect security
- The security of your Content depends on the security of your devices and browsers
- If Access Codes, Direct Links, or passwords are compromised, the Content may be accessed by unauthorized parties
- Advances in cryptanalysis or quantum computing may eventually threaten current encryption standards
            ` }, { id: "storage", title: "9. File Storage and Retention", content: `
### Storage Infrastructure

VaultBridge utilizes secure cloud infrastructure for storing encrypted Content:
- Files are stored in encrypted form on cloud storage services with industry-standard security certifications
- Geographic redundancy may be employed for reliability
- All stored data is encrypted at rest using platform encryption in addition to VaultBridge's client-side encryption

### Retention Periods

Content is retained only until one of the following occurs:
- **User-Defined Expiration**: The expiration time set by the Sender (1 hour to 7 days)
- **Download Limit**: The download limit set by the Sender (1 to 100 downloads)
- **Manual Deletion**: If features enable manual deletion by the Sender

### Deletion Process

When Content is deleted:
- All encrypted file chunks are permanently removed from storage
- Vault metadata records are deleted from the database
- No backups or copies are retained
- Deletion is immediate and synchronous for download-limit triggers

### Size Limits

VaultBridge may impose file and Vault size limits:
- Maximum individual file size: Subject to network and browser constraints
- Maximum total Vault size: Subject to change based on infrastructure capacity
- Maximum files per Vault: Subject to practical limits

### No Backup or Recovery

VaultBridge does not maintain backups of encrypted Content. This design choice:
- Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to historical data
- Ensures that deletion is truly permanent
- Means we cannot recover Content that has been deleted or encrypted with lost keys
